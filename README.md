## Blockchain Integrations

### Solana Integration

solΦ interacts with the Solana blockchain in the following ways:

1. **Account Management**: Creates and manages Solana accounts for data transactions.

2. **Transaction Management**: Creates, signs, and sends transactions containing compressed analytics data.

3. **Data Access**: Retrieves data stored on the blockchain and opens it for local use.

4. **Balance Monitoring**: Maintains sufficient SOL balance for transaction fees.

Solana’s high throughput (65,000 TPS) and low latency (400ms block time) enable near real-time data storage and access.

### Sei Integration

The integration with the Sei blockchain includes the following features:

1. **Smart Contract Development**: Develops custom smart contracts on Sei using CosmWasm.
2. **SEI Token Integration**: Users are rewarded with SEI tokens.

3. **High Throughput Transactions**: Fast and efficient transactions are performed with Sei's FCAS (Frequent Batch Auctions) mechanism.

4. **Parallel Execution**: System performance is increased by using Sei's parallel transaction execution feature.

### Wormhole Bridge Integration

The Wormhole protocol enables solΦ to perform secure and efficient cross-chain transactions between Solana and Sei:

1. **Token Bridge**: Bidirectional transfers between SOL and SEI tokens.

2. **Data Bridge**: Inter-blockchain data transfer and synchronization.

3. **Secure Messaging**: Secure message transmission between different blockchains.

4. **Atomic Swaps**: Atomic swap transactions for cross-chain token swaps.

## Revenue Model

solΦ's revenue model is based on advertisers creating campaigns on our app:

1. **Advertising Revenue**: Main source of campaign revenue.

2. **Revenue Share**: 10% of campaign revenue is distributed to users via blinks.

3. **Cross-Chain Transaction Fees**: Minimal fees charged for transactions made via the Wormhole bridge.

4. **Premium Features**: Advanced analytics and targeting tools for advertisers.
